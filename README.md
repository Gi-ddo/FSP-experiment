#FSP-experiment

This project was my June exam for my 3rd year game design course. 
I wanted to continue exploring FPS games as my previous project was
my first attempt at an FPS in Unity. For this one I explored the concept
of projectile based shooting and how I could achieve this using the unity engine.
It was fun experiment and a worth while learing experience. 

A full documentation of my process through this project will be linked below:
